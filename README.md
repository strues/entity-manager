## Services

The Entity Manager integration provides services for managing entities:

### `entity_manager.enable_entity`

Enable a disabled entity.

**Service Data:**
- `entity_id` (required): The entity ID to enable.

**Example:**
```yaml
service: entity_manager.enable_entity
data:
  entity_id: sensor.my_sensor
```

### `entity_manager.disable_entity`

Disable an entity.

**Service Data:**
- `entity_id` (required): The entity ID to disable.

### `entity_manager.bulk_rename`

Rename multiple entities in the registry.

**Service Data:**
- `renames` (required): List of `entity_id` → `new_entity_id` rename operations.
- `dry_run` (optional): Log planned renames without applying changes.
- `skip_missing` (optional): Skip entities that are not found (default true).

**Example:**
```yaml
service: entity_manager.bulk_rename
data:
  renames:
    - entity_id: sensor.kitchen_temperature
      new_entity_id: sensor.kitchen_temp
    - entity_id: sensor.office_humidity
      new_entity_id: sensor.office_hum
  dry_run: false
  skip_missing: true
```
Voice Assistant Integration

Entity Manager provides services that can be used with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home through automations.

### Setup Voice Commands

Create automations to respond to voice commands:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Voice - Disable Entity"
    trigger:
      - platform: conversation
        command: "disable entity *"
    action:
      - service: entity_manager.disable_entity
        data:
          entity_id: "{{ trigger.sentence | replace('disable entity ', '') }}"
  
  - alias: "Voice - Enable Entity"
    trigger:
      - platform: conversation
        command: "enable entity *"
    action:
      - service: entity_manager.enable_entity
        data:
          entity_id: "{{ trigger.sentence | replace('enable entity ', '') }}"
```

### Using with Alexa/Google Home

1. Set up Home Assistant Cloud or Nabu Casa
2. Expose the automation to your voice assistant
3. Say: "Alexa, turn on voice disable entity" or "Hey Google, activate voice enable entity"

Alternatively, create routines in your Alexa or Google Home app that call the Entity Manager services directly.

## Dashboard Card

Entity Manager includes a Lovelace card for managing entities from your dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:entity-manager-card
```

The card provides:
- Search and filter entities by ID, device, or integration
- Multi-select entity management
- Bulk enable/disable operations
- Expandable groups by integration and device

## 
**Example:**
```yaml
service: entity_manager.disable_entity
data:
  entity_id: sensor.my_sensor
```

## Use Cases

- Programmatically enable/disable entities based on conditions
- Bulk entity management through automations
- Dynamic entity control in scripts
- Integration with other Home Assistant automations

## Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Disable sensor when away"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.away_mode
        to: 'on'
    action:
      - service: entity_manager.disable_entity
        data:
          entity_id: sensor.energy_monitor
```

## Notes

- Entities must exist in the entity registry to be managed
- Disabled entities will not be available in the UI or automations until re-enabled
- Changes take effect immediately but may require a page refresh to see in the UI
